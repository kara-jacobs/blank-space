=================Brief written explanation of the results of MY tests and what I had to fix:

All the results of my tests worked as intended. For the “Enter your name” box, if I entered nothing and then pressed the confirm button, an error label alerted me to the mistake. Likewise, if I tried entering less than 3 characters, more than 40 characters, or a number, the appropriate alert labels were shown.

For the “Enter your ID number” box, if I tried entering letters, symbols, or floats instead of integers, an error label appeared.

In addition, all of the buttons and radiobuttons worked as intended.


I had some difficulty getting the user input validation to work initially, when I was trying to use while loops, but after watching some tutorials on YouTube, I found some easy ways to make the code work using if-else statements and try-except statements.
